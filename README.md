# Feature Scaling and Normalization for Machine Learning Preprocessing

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates the importance of **Feature Scaling and Normalization**
as part of the data preprocessing stage in Machine Learning.

Feature scaling ensures that all input features have a similar scale, which helps
machine learning algorithms perform better and converge faster.
